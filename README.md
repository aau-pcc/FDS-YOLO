# Multi-objective Bud Detection and Counting Model for Real Tea Plantation Environments<br>真实茶园环境中的多目标茶芽检测和计数模型.
## Introduction<br>
### This repository is built for:<br>
#### TeaBudVis（Xiaolanhua）<br>
TeaBudVis tea bud dataset photographed in early April 2024, tea buds are dense and shaded, labelled with only one tea category. Total 3070 images.<br>
The image is shown below:https://github.com/aau-pcc/FDS-YOLO/blob/main/TeaBudVis/Images/2024_04_07_10_47_IMG_3490.jpg<br>
#### DiverseBudSet（Huangjinya、Longjinchangye、Zhongcha111）<br>
Collected in early, mid and late March 2025, respectively. In early March, the number of single bracts and single buds in the images was higher and the targets were smaller, more attached to the branch tips or obscured by the leaves, which was not easy to identify; in mid-March, the images were taken in rainy days with insufficient light, and the background was blurred under the shade of rainwater, which affected the details of the characteristics of the tea buds; in late March, compared with the two previous periods, the tea buds were growing rapidly, and the growth of the one-leaf shoots and one-leaf shoots was more intensive and there was significant The background is blurred by water, which affects the details of the tea buds' features.<br>
